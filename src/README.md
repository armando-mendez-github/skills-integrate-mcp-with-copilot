## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/activities`                                                     | Get all activities with their details and current participant count |
| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity                                             |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.

## Security Conventions

- Do not add endpoints that accept raw SQL strings from users.
- Validate user-supplied values before they reach persistence/query layers.
- When database support is introduced, use parameterized queries or ORM-generated SQL only.

Unsafe pattern (never allow):

```python
# Never execute user input as SQL
cursor.execute(user_sql)
```

Safe pattern (parameterized):

```python
cursor.execute(
   "SELECT * FROM activities WHERE name = ?",
   (activity_name,),
)
```
